          <p class="text-muted">A cloud forest or fog forest is a (usually) tropical or subtropical, contains mostly evergreen trees, and is high up on a mountain. There is a large amount of water in the air. Cloud forests have cloud cover for much of the year, usually at the same height as the canopy, the place where the trees' branches meet.

            Cloud forests often have mosses covering the ground and large plants. Such mossy forests usually grow on the saddles of mountains, where the wind cannot blow away moisture from clouds.
            
            Cloud forests grow from 500 to 4000 meters above sea level. Usually, they grow where the fog is right at the level where the plants grow, so there is less sunlight to burn away the mist. Many of the plants take water through fog drip. Fog drip is when water forms drops on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below.</p>

  <p>It may be a long time before viewers can appreciate
     the 2019 remake of "The Lion King" as a freestanding
      work, instead of judging it against the original. The 1994
       version was "Hamlet" plus "Bambi" on the African veldt: a 
       childhood-shaping, Oscar-winning blockbuster, the second-
       highest grossing feature film of its calendar year, one of the last great hand-drawn Disney animated features (Pixar's original "Toy Story" came out 18 months later), and a tear-producing machine. This remake was controversial long before it opened, mainly because it seemed to take the Walt Disney company's new branding strategy—remaking beloved animated films as CGI-dependent "live action" spectaculars—to its most drastic conclusion. It serves up the same story with different actors, different arrangements of beloved songs and soundtrack cues, a couple of original tunes, a few fresh scenes and sequences, and, of course, photorealistic animals. The latter are the movie's main selling point, so believable that one of my kids remarked afterward that sitting through the film was like watching a nature documentary on mute while the soundtrack to original "The Lion King" played in the background.</p>
